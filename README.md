# SECTORAL AND SPATIAL LINKAGES IN THE EC PRODUCTION STRUCTURE

This program takes a Forward Linkage map and generates a total forward link table and Key Contributors table as demonstrated here:
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-4146.00053/abstract
It creates two new .csv files with the specified tables.
It takes inputs of the Forward Linkage map and the number of sectors per region. 
Optionally you can specify the number of reported key contributors.


Recommended usage is running the .exe from command line with the form

LinkageBuilder.exe "inputfile.csv" [number of sectors per region] (optional)[number of reported key contributors]
